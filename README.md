# Interview preparation

This repository contains the problems that I have solved during my interview preparation from autumn 23 till spring 24. The problem set was taken from the book "Cracking the coding interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, 6th edition. Unfortunately, I initialized this repo after going through some topics. That is, it's not complete.
